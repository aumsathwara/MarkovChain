# MarkovChain
Intro:
   A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.
How does this work:
   It takes "english_speech_2" as it's previous event to predict further series of strings.
How to make it work:
   Place english_speech_2 in the same directory as in MarkovChain.py.That's it!!
   Now it works perfectly fine.You can further make changes in your code by changing the word used to prompt method "generateText".
   I have used people to generate result.You can use any 4 letter word.
